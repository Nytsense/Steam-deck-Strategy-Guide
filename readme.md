## Launchers
- [EA](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/qhq3pn/ea_desktop_finally_working/) 

>(Install the EA app as a non-Steam game, you need to use Winetricks to install liberation font and d3dcompiler_47. On the Steam Deck, Winetricks can be done through the Protontricks app from Discover. After I installed those 2, the EA App worked.) 

- [Epic and GOG](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/how-to-install-non-steam-games-on-steam-deck#:~:text=Navigate%20the%20top%2Dmost%20menu,then%20hit%20Add%20selected%20programs.) 

>(Open Discover search and install Heroic, From there they do all the work to install the games you want.)

- [Uplay](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/how-to-install-non-steam-games-on-steam-deck#:~:text=Navigate%20the%20top%2Dmost%20menu,then%20hit%20Add%20selected%20programs.)

>(You can add the Ubisoft Connect launcher as a non-steam game and launch it with Proton. You can then launch games through that launcher, and they'll run.
the only issue is really anticheat. Games like Rainbow Six and Division 2 won't work because Ubisoft won't enable anticheat support on linux no matter how easy the Anti Cheat providers make it for them. Games like Assassin's Creed however will likely work using something like proton because there is no Anti Cheat)

## Broke something? Just need a new part in general?
